- Why do tables need a primary key?

    A: A primary key is a table column that serves a special purpose. Each database table needs a primary key because it ensures row-level accessibility. ... The values that compose a primary key column are unique; no two values are the same. Each table has one and only one primary key, which can consist of one or many columns.

- What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

    A: Foreign Key

- What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

    A: To avoid this problem, you can break the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships by using a third table, called a join table. Each record in a join table includes a match field that contains the value of the primary keys of the two tables it joins.
